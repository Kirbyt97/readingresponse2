               <h2>Pilgrim-Inroduction</h2>
                <p>The introduction in Pilgrim’s &ldquo;HTML Book&rdquo; begins by explaining what HTML is. HTML is made up of many different features and these features interact with other programs such as JavaScript. HTML5 expands on the previous model without making the users learn a whole new set of rules. These new features make using HTML much easier and allows for greater customization. It is easy to upgrade to this new model and all you have to do is change your <i>doctype.</i> This new model of HTML is already supported on popular browsers, listed below. The founder of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee, has condoned HTML5 and plans to help it develop further. 
                <li>Firefox</li>
                <li>Safari</li>
                <li>Chrome</li>
                <li>Mobile Browsers</li>  
                </p>

                <p><b>What is a MIME></b><br>A MIME is a header that lets the browser know how to display the page. Things like images and JavaScript and countless others also have their own MIME type. Everything that is displayed on the web, for the most part, has a MIME type.
                </p>
                <p><b>The Development of a Tag</b><br>
                Pilgrim displays a now twenty-four-year-old email chain between several important developers. This chain marks the beginning of the &ldquo;IMG&rdquo; tag. This tag is used in almost all modern websites and is very important. Developers collaborate and share their ideas to come up with the best version of the tag. However, it was Marc Andreessen of Mosaic who shipped the code. This is why it is called IMG, not ICON or INCLUDE. 
                </p>
                <p><b>The Difference with XHTML and MIMES</b><br>
                HTML is a web designer that allows for simple mistakes to be “forgiven.” This lead to the vast majority of all HTML web pages to have some sort of an error in them. XML set out to fix this problem. In this new model, it was not possible to fail on the first error for not being well formed. Most people did not like this new feature because it displayed constant errors to the user due to most existing pages having these errors. However, many people preferred XHTML syntax so using it with an HTML MIME type became popular. This caused HTML to develop new syntax and forms which lead to the creation of HTML5.

                <h2>A VT-Shaped Student</h2>
                <p>This is a brief summary of what a VT-Shaped Student is as outline on the Virginia Tech website and relating articles. Virginia Tech takes great pride in their student’s achievements. In an attempt to encourage students to better themselves even further Tech has created the notion of a VT-Shaped Student. </p>
                <p><b>The T</b><br>
                There are two parts to the T:
                <li>Horizontal</li>
                <li>Vertical</li>  
                <dl>
                    <dt><b>Horizontal</b></dt>
                   <dd>Represents the strength a student as within their chosen discipline. Tech students are expected to be the best at what they do in their given fields.</dd>
                   <dt><b>Vertical</b></dt>
                   <dd>The vertical portion represents being an interdisciplinary student. It is required that students take courses outside of their chosen fields in order to expand their knowledge.</dd>          
                </dl>
                
                <p><b>The V</b><br>The V-This represents students learning outside of the class room. Tech students are also expected to be active members in their community and live out the school motto of Ut Prosim. At Tech there are many opportunities to learn outside of class such as:
                <li>Living-Learning Communities</li>
                <li>Study Abroad</li>
                <li>Undergraduate Research</li>
                </p>
                
                <h2>Quotations</h2>
                <p>
                <li>Introduction- &ldquo;You may well ask: “How can I start using HTML5 if older browsers don’t support it?” But the question itself is misleading. HTML5 is not one big thing; it is a collection of individual features. So you can’t detect “HTML5 support,” because that doesn’t make any sense. But you can detect support for individual features, like canvas, video, or geolocation.&rdquo;</li>
                <li>A Quite Biased History of HTML5- &ldquo;This idea was not universally popular. With an estimated error rate of 99% on existing pages, the ever-present possibility of displaying errors to the end user, and the dearth of new features in XHTML 1.0 and 1.1 to justify the cost, web authors basically ignored application/xhtml+xml. But that doesn’t mean they ignored XHTML altogether. Oh, most definitely not. Appendix C of the XHTML 1.0 specification gave the web authors of the world a loophole: “Use something that looks kind of like XHTML syntax, but keep serving it with the text/html MIME type.” And that’s exactly what thousands of web developers did: they “upgraded” to XHTML syntax but kept serving it with a text/html MIME type.&rdquo; </li>
                <li>A VT-Shaped Student: Official Introduction- &ldquo;We want to prepare students who can tackle the complex global problems and opportunities of the future,” said President Tim Sands. “To do that, students need to be adaptable, resilient, and culturally competent, seeing the world through the lens of empathy and our university’s motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve). &rdquo; </li>
                <li>A VT-Shaped Student: Description-&ldquo;Engaging the world does not necessarily mean significantly increasing Virginia Tech’s permanent physical footprint. Global engagement hubs will be distributed around the world supporting engagements of weeks or months or years, depending on the time scale of the problem under consideration. The hubs will be integrated with local communities and, in some cases, dependent upon local support.&rdquo;</li> 
                <li>A VT-Shaped Student: CLAHS VT-Shaped Learner- &ldquo;We want our students to be able to think from art to science as Galileo did, from science to art as Leonardo did. Today, our problems are larger and more complex than ever. Not all of the solutions to those problems will be technological. Indeed, some of those problems arise from the mistaken belief that technology can ever be separated from the people who use that technology.&rdquo;</li>
                <li>A VT-Shaped Student: Office for VT-Shaped Learning- &ldquo;“The greatest of land-grant institutions continue to integrate practical and liberal education, and they do so because technology never works without people as part of the equation, because innovation is fundamentally a human pursuit.”&rdquo; </li>
                <li>A VT-Shaped Student: Interview with Provost Rikakis- &ldquo;“Universities today have to be thinking … about how we’re going to do and provide education at the undergraduate and graduate level, how we’re going to serve our various constituency groups,” DePauw said. “We need to be thinking more quickly because change is happening so fast. We have to try as hard as we can to be ahead of the curve.”&rdquo; </li>

            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <p>
            <li>Out of all the different web formatting tools, how did HTML become the most widely used?</li>
            <li>How can we encourage students in in the sciences involved undergraduate  research on campus? </li>
            <li>How can we get more Virginia Tech students involved in extracurricular activites? </li>
